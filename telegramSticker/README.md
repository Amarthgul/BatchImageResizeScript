# Batch Image Resize

Used for resize images, especially for large amounts of images.

Orignally coded to resize a batch of images in order to fit the Telegram stickers' requirement, hence the output images are `512 * (>=512)` pixels, you can change it in the code via variable 'maxsize'.

# Execuable file User Guide:

Copy the .exe file to where your images are, then run it by double click or right-click and run, a new folder called 'OutputImages' will be created in which contains images resized to `512 * (>=512)` resloution, with alpha/opacity reserved if exists.

Update 12/28/2017: No update, I simply found that code massy and shitty.
