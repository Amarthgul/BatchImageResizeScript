# BatchImageResizeScript

Used for resize images, especially for large amounts of pics.

Orignally coded to resize a batch of images in order to fit the telegram tickers' requirement, hence the output images are 512 * [smaller] pixels, you can change it in the SourceCode, variable 'maxsize' decides the max size of image, equal scaling.

Execuable file User Guide:
Copy the .exe file to where your images are, then run it by double click or right-click-run, a new folder called 'OutputImages' will be created in which contains images resized to 512 * [smaller] resloution, with alpha/opacity reserved if exists.

Update 12/28/2017: No update, I simply found that code massy and shitty.
